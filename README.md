ML_HTGR

This Machine Learning Project was designed to teach beginners about the basics of Machine Learning, how to make  models and to improve their understanding of different algorithms used by different Machine Learning Models. Over the course of the semester we took a kaggle dataset with labelled data (insert dataset link), cleaned it up and split it in order to train and test our models. The data set was a car acceleration data set that would be used to determine if the car accelerated, turned right, turned left or braked. We ended up making 3 models by the end of the semester to understand and teach the machine the same. We made a LSTM Model, SVM Model and a Random Forest Model to see if we could accurately predict driving behaviors based on the given dataset with all three models. The accuracies of these models differed at the end because of each model using a different algorithm to predict the behavior (label).
