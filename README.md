## 1. Data Cleaning With Pandas
   This project focuses on data cleaning using the Kaggle dataset, [Driving Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/driving-behavior-dataset) <br>
   We have narrowed down our focus to 12 specific columns out of a total of 61. These columns include:
* "AccMedianX", "AccMedianY", "AccMedianZ", "GyroMeanX", "GyroMeanY", "GyroMeanZ", "GyroMedianX", "GyroMedianY", and "GyroMedianZ"
